	<h1>About Splurty</h1>

	<p>
		Splurty was built by me—<a href="https://github.com/CodeFlowed">Stephen</a>—a <a href="http://www.thefirehoseproject.com/">FirehoseProject</a> padawan (living in Hawaii) who's training in Ruby coding and web development. This Splurty app collects and displays quotes from one of my favorite cartoons: "<a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/adventuretime/index.html?atclk_vn=nav_Adventure-Time">Adventure Time</a>". This app is my first project working with Rails and a database. Huzzah!
